# Stripe Subscription System Fix

## Problem Overview

We identified a critical issue with the Stripe subscription system where users were being charged for one-time payments instead of recurring subscriptions. This resulted in:

1. Users paying $1.00 instead of $25.00 due to an incorrect price configuration
2. Users getting PRO access but without a proper Stripe customer ID or subscription
3. Webhook processing not properly creating recurring subscriptions

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Price Configuration Fix
- Updated `MINATO_PRO_PRICE_CENTS` from 100 ($1.00) to 2500 ($25.00) in `lib/constants.ts`
- Updated `MINATO_PRO_PRICE_DISPLAY` to '$25.00'

### 2. Webhook Processing Fix
- Enhanced the webhook handler in `app/api/stripe-webhooks/route.ts` to:
  - Create a Stripe customer if one doesn't exist
  - Create a proper recurring subscription instead of a one-time payment
  - Store the subscription details in the database
  - Update the user's plan type to PRO with the correct subscription end date

### 3. Manual Fixes for Affected Users
- For user 2a581fe6-a710-4ed6-80aa-5503de894864 (renemakoule38@gmail.com):
  - Updated their plan type to PRO
  - Set subscription end date to 30 days from now
  - Note: This user still doesn't have a proper Stripe customer ID for renewals

- For user 4c7f219e-39e1-41a5-a204-f08be8c88d1b (renemakoule@gmail.com):
  - Cleared their incomplete payment attempts
  - Removed their Stripe customer ID to allow for a fresh payment attempt

## Recommendations for Future

1. **Testing Procedure**:
   - Always test the subscription flow in a test environment before deploying to production
   - Use Stripe test mode to verify the entire subscription lifecycle
   - Verify webhook processing with Stripe CLI

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Implement regular audits of subscription statuses
   - Add alerts for failed webhook processing
   - Monitor for discrepancies between Stripe and database records

3. **Code Improvements**:
   - Use a dedicated subscription service class to centralize subscription logic
   - Implement retry mechanisms for failed webhook processing
   - Add comprehensive logging for all subscription-related events

4. **Documentation**:
   - Document the subscription flow for future developers
   - Create a troubleshooting guide for common subscription issues
   - Document the database schema for subscription-related tables

## How to Verify the Fix

1. Create a new test user
2. Subscribe to the PRO plan
3. Verify in Stripe dashboard that:
   - A customer was created
   - A subscription was created with the correct price ($25.00)
   - The subscription is set to renew monthly
4. Verify in the database that:
   - User's plan_type is set to PRO
   - User has a stripe_customer_id
   - User has a subscription_end_date set to 1 month from now
   - There's an entry in stripe_subscriptions table
