# Stripe Subscription System Audit & Fixes

## Issues Identified

During our audit of the Stripe subscription system, we identified several critical issues:

### 1. Price Mismatch Issue
- **Problem**: The price in `lib/constants.ts` was incorrectly set to $1.00 (100 cents) instead of $25.00 (2500 cents)
- **Impact**: Customers were charged $1.00 instead of $25.00
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed by updating `MINATO_PRO_PRICE_CENTS` to 2500

### 2. Webhook Processing Issues
- **Problem**: Webhook events weren't being properly processed
- **Impact**: Successful payments didn't update user subscription status
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed by adding debug endpoint and correcting webhook handler code

### 3. Multiple Payment Attempts
- **Problem**: Users experienced multiple failed payment attempts
- **Impact**: Frustrating user experience, potential card blocks
- **Status**: ✅ Created script to cancel incomplete payment intents

### 4. Database Schema Issues
- **Problem**: Missing columns in `processed_stripe_events` table
- **Impact**: Limited ability to debug webhook issues
- **Status**: ⚠️ Needs implementation of schema updates

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Price Configuration Fix
- Updated `lib/constants.ts` with correct price: $25.00 (2500 cents)
- Fixed display price to show "$25.00" consistently

### 2. Webhook Processing Improvements
- Created debug webhook endpoint at `/api/stripe-webhooks/debug`
- Fixed syntax error in webhook handler for pro_upgrade events

### 3. Payment Recovery
- Created script to diagnose and fix incomplete payment issues
- Manually updated subscription status for user who paid $1.00

## Recommendations for Future Prevention

### 1. Implement Comprehensive Testing
```typescript
// Example test for price consistency
test('Stripe price constants are correctly configured', () => {
  expect(STRIPE_CONFIG.MINATO_PRO_PRICE_CENTS).toBe(2500);
  expect(STRIPE_CONFIG.MINATO_PRO_PRICE_DISPLAY).toBe('$25.00');
});

// Example test for webhook processing
test('Webhook handler processes checkout.session.completed correctly', async () => {
  const mockEvent = createMockStripeEvent('checkout.session.completed');
  await handleStripeEvent(mockEvent);
  // Verify database was updated correctly
});
```

### 2. Improve Webhook Monitoring
- Set up real-time alerts for webhook failures
- Log all webhook events in a structured format
- Create a dashboard to monitor webhook processing status

### 3. Enhance Database Schema
```sql
-- Add missing columns to processed_stripe_events
ALTER TABLE processed_stripe_events 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS event_type TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS webhook_endpoint TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS metadata JSONB;

-- Create index for faster lookups
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_processed_stripe_events_event_type 
ON processed_stripe_events(event_type);
```

### 4. Implement Idempotent Processing
- Ensure all webhook handlers are idempotent
- Use transaction IDs to prevent duplicate processing
- Add retry logic for failed webhook processing

### 5. Add User-Facing Error Handling
- Show clear error messages for payment failures
- Provide guidance on how to resolve payment issues
- Implement automatic retry for failed payments

### 6. Regular Audits
- Schedule monthly audits of subscription system
- Verify price consistency across all components
- Check for users with mismatched subscription status

## Next Steps

1. Implement the database schema updates
2. Set up monitoring for webhook processing
3. Add comprehensive tests for the subscription system
4. Create a user-facing dashboard for subscription management
