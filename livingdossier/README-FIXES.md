# Living Dossier Fixes

This document describes the fixes made to address TypeScript and Python import errors in the Living Dossier codebase.

## TypeScript Fixes

1. **Added missing `buildTaskConceptMappings` function in ConceptLibrary.ts**
   - The function was imported in PlaybookGenerator.ts but was not defined in ConceptLibrary.ts
   - Added implementation that maps tasks to semantic concepts based on keyword overlap

## Python Structure Fixes

1. **Fixed Python import structure**
   - Updated `livingdossier/__init__.py` to add the parent directory to sys.path
   - This allows imports from the root project directory

2. **Created stub implementations for missing modules**
   - Created `utils/auth_utils.py` with stub functions for authentication utilities
   - Created stub implementations for agent-related modules:
     - `agent/prompt.py` with `get_system_prompt` function
     - `agent/gemini_prompt.py` with `get_gemini_system_prompt` function
     - `agent/agent_builder_prompt.py` with `get_agent_builder_prompt` function
     - `agent/tools/message_tool.py` with `MessageTool` class
     - `agent/tools/expand_msg_tool.py` with `ExpandMessageTool` class

## TypeScript Fixes - 2024-07-XX

### Fixed PlaybookGenerator.ts and SemanticMatcher.ts

Fixed several TypeScript errors in the PlaybookGenerator.ts and SemanticMatcher.ts files:

1. Fixed imports and type compatibility between `DynamicSemanticConcept` and `SemanticConcept`
   - Added proper imports from './SemanticMatcher' and './ConceptLibrary'
   - Created a `convertToSemanticConcepts` helper function to convert between types

2. Fixed the `generateDynamicTask` function
   - Updated parameter types and return type
   - Fixed the `buildTaskConceptMappings` call to use the correct parameters
   - Used the conversion function for type compatibility

3. Fixed Map and Set iteration issues in SemanticMatcher.ts
   - Replaced direct iteration over `Map.entries()` with `Array.from()`
   - Replaced direct iteration over `Set` with `Array.from()` or `forEach`
   - Added missing methods like `normalize`, `calculateSimilarityScore`, and `buildConceptKeywordMap`

4. Added missing `ConceptMatch` interface with required properties

These changes ensure type safety and compatibility with the ES5 target used in the project.

### Remaining Issues

There is still one error related to the '@anthropic-ai/sdk' module in services/llm/anthropic.ts. This would require installing the package or creating type declarations, but it's outside the scope of the current fix.

## Next Steps

1. **Replace stub implementations with actual functionality**
   - The stub implementations provide the necessary structure but lack actual functionality
   - Replace them with proper implementations as needed

2. **Check for additional import errors**
   - There may be other import errors that were not addressed
   - Test the code and fix any remaining issues

3. **Update Python imports**
   - Consider updating the imports in the Python files to use relative imports where appropriate
   - This would make the code more maintainable and less dependent on sys.path manipulation
