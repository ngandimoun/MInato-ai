# Dynamic Domain Handling for Living Dossier

This document describes the enhanced capabilities implemented for the Living Dossier feature to handle queries outside predefined domains. These improvements enable the system to adapt and generate high-quality reports for any topic, including specialized fields not explicitly defined in the strategy components.

## Overview

The dynamic domain handling system allows the Living Dossier to:

1. **Identify when a query falls outside predefined domains**
2. **Dynamically generate appropriate tasks for analysis**
3. **Expand its concept library with new domains**
4. **Learn from user feedback to improve future responses**
5. **Provide comprehensive analysis even for niche or emerging fields**

## Key Components

### 1. Domain Discovery Meta-Task

A specialized meta-task has been added to the strategy components that activates when the system encounters queries outside its predefined domains:

```yaml
meta_tasks:
  - id: "domain_discovery"
    description: "Discover and analyze a new domain not covered in existing components"
    type: "llm"
    base_score: 100
    triggers:
      - keyword: "new field"
        weight: 100
      # Additional multilingual triggers
```

This task provides a structured approach to analyzing new domains, including:
- Domain identification
- Key concepts and terminology
- Analytical frameworks
- Important metrics
- Data sources
- Current trends
- Key stakeholders

### 2. Dynamic Task Generation

The system can now generate tasks on-the-fly for domains not covered by existing tasks:

```typescript
export async function generateDynamicTask(query: string, domain: string): Promise<PlaybookTask> {
  // Dynamically creates a task definition tailored to the specific query and domain
}
```

This function uses LLM capabilities to:
- Create appropriate task descriptions
- Generate comprehensive analysis prompts
- Structure the output for consistency with predefined tasks

### 3. Zero-Shot Task Execution

As a fallback mechanism, the system can execute zero-shot tasks when no suitable predefined or dynamically generated tasks are available:

```typescript
export async function executeZeroShotTask(query: string, dossierId: string): Promise<TaskResult> {
  // Executes a general-purpose analysis without task-specific templates
}
```

This ensures that users always receive a response, even for the most unusual or specialized queries.

### 4. Self-Expanding Concept Library

The system now automatically expands its concept library based on new queries:

```typescript
public async expandConceptLibrary(query: string, language: string = 'en'): Promise<SemanticConcept[]> {
  // Extracts new concepts from queries and adds them to the library
}
```

This allows the system to:
- Learn new domain concepts
- Build multilingual synonyms
- Establish relationships between concepts
- Improve future matching accuracy

### 5. Feedback Loop System

A feedback mechanism has been implemented to incorporate user feedback and continuously improve the system:

```typescript
export async function incorporateFeedback(
  dossierId: string,
  feedback: string,
  rating?: number
): Promise<boolean> {
  // Extracts insights from feedback and updates the system
}
```

This function:
- Analyzes user feedback
- Identifies missing concepts
- Suggests task improvements
- Adds new trigger keywords
- Saves expanded concept libraries

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced PlaybookGenerator

The PlaybookGenerator has been updated to:
- Include meta_tasks in task selection
- Prioritize high-confidence matches
- Fall back to meta-tasks when no good matches are found
- Add a default task as a final fallback

### Modified ExecutionEngine

The ExecutionEngine now supports:
- Dynamic task generation and execution
- Zero-shot task execution
- Improved error handling with fallbacks

### Updated Index.ts

The main entry point has been enhanced with:
- Concept library expansion for each query
- Dynamic task generation when needed
- Zero-shot fallback for error cases
- Feedback incorporation mechanism

## Benefits

1. **Universal Coverage**: The system can now handle queries across ANY domain, not just those predefined in strategy components
2. **Continuous Learning**: The system evolves and improves with each query through concept expansion
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Multiple fallback mechanisms ensure users always receive high-quality analysis
4. **User-Driven Improvement**: Feedback loop allows the system to learn from user experiences
5. **Multilingual Support**: All enhancements work across multiple languages

## Future Improvements

1. **Vector Embeddings**: Implement vector embeddings for more accurate semantic matching
2. **Automatic Strategy Component Generation**: Create new strategy components based on frequently encountered domains
3. **Cross-Domain Analysis**: Develop capabilities to analyze topics that span multiple domains
4. **Personalized Domain Adaptation**: Adapt to individual user interests and expertise levels
5. **Collaborative Learning**: Share learned concepts across users while maintaining privacy

## Conclusion

With these enhancements, the Living Dossier system is now capable of generating highly detailed and interactive reports about ANY field, including all those listed in the strategy components YAML file and beyond. The system will continue to evolve and improve as it encounters new domains and receives user feedback.
