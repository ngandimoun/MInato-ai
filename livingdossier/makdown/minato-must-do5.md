Of course. This is the perfect stress test for Minato's capabilities. A user who is a professional but comes with **no data of their own** is entirely reliant on Minato's ability to perform **just-in-time, live-web research** and synthesize it into a world-class strategic dossier.

This scenario showcases Minato's power at its absolute peak. Let's choose a modern, complex, and high-stakes professional pain point.

### **The Professional & The Pain Point**

*   **The Professional:** A **Director of Product Marketing** at a successful, mid-sized B2B SaaS company (e.g., a company that sells project management software).
*   **Her Pain Point & High-Stakes Question:** "The executive team just had a meeting. They are convinced that **AI is the future** and are pressuring my team to **'add AI features'** to our product. I have no idea where to start. Is this just a hype-driven distraction, or is there a real customer need? If it's real, what specific AI features should we actually build? I need to go back to the board in two weeks with a data-driven strategy, not just an opinion."

**Why a Human Struggles:** This is an incredibly common but difficult problem. The "AI" space is full of noise, hype, and technical jargon. The Product Marketer needs to quickly cut through it all to understand three things:
1.  Are our **customers** actually asking for this?
2.  What are our **competitors** *really* doing with AI (not just what their press releases say)?
3.  Which AI features would provide the **highest value** to our specific users?

This would normally take weeks of frantic, fragmented research.

### **Minato's "360Â° AI Feature Strategy Dossier" Workflow**

**The User Query:** *"I'm a Product Marketing Director for a project management SaaS. The board wants us to add AI features. Give me a full strategic analysis on whether we should do this, and if so, what features to build."*

#### **Phase 1: Diagnosis & Multi-Pronged "Live Web" Research**

1.  **Intent Deconstruction:** `{ goal: "new_feature_viability", product_category: "B2B SaaS - Project Management", new_feature_concept: "AI" }`.

2.  **Dynamic Playbook Generation:** The AI Brain knows it needs to understand the customer, the competition, and the technology. It assembles a playbook:
    *   `find_reddit_customer_voice`: To find what real project managers are complaining about.
    *   `analyze_competitor_ai_features`: A new, powerful component.
    *   `find_tech_trend_analysis_reports`: To get high-level market context.
    *   `generate_feature_prioritization_matrix`: A new analysis framework.
    *   `synthesize_final_report_with_roadmap`.

3.  **Just-In-Time Data Acquisition (Minato's Senses at Work):**
    *   **Task 1 (`find_reddit_customer_voice`):**
        *   **Tool:** Browser Use.
        *   **Action:** Scrapes `r/projectmanagement`, `r/sysadmin`, and other related subreddits for posts containing keywords like "hate", "annoying", "wish I could", "manual work." It is **not** searching for "AI." It is searching for **the underlying problems that AI could solve.**
        *   **Result:** A list of raw complaints: *"I waste hours every week manually writing status reports for my stakeholders."* *"My team can never accurately estimate how long a project will take."* *"Assigning tasks to the right person is a constant headache."*

    *   **Task 2 (`analyze_competitor_ai_features`):**
        *   **Tool:** Browser Use.
        *   **Action:** This is a multi-step deep dive.
            1.  It identifies the top 3 competitors (e.g., Asana, Monday.com, Trello).
            2.  It goes to their official websites, specifically their "What's New" and "Pricing" pages.
            3.  It scrapes the descriptions of any feature that mentions "AI," "Automated," "Smart," or "Intelligent."
        *   **Result:** A structured list of what competitors are *actually shipping*: `"Asana: AI-powered project summary generator."`, `"Monday.com: AI assistant to create task lists from text."`, `"Trello: AI-powered automation rules."`

    *   **Task 3 (`find_tech_trend_analysis_reports`):**
        *   **Tool:** Serper + Browser Use.
        *   **Action:** Searches for reports from reputable sources like Gartner, Forrester, or top tech blogs on "AI in project management."
        *   **Result:** High-level strategic context, e.g., "The market is moving towards generative AI for reporting and predictive analytics for timeline forecasting."

#### **Phase 2: The "Living Dossier" - The Interactive Strategy App**

Minato now has all the raw data. Its brain generates a **Streamlit application** to help the Product Marketing Director think and decide.

**The "AI Feature Strategy" Streamlit App:**

*   **Section 1: The "Voice of the Customer" - Your Users' Real Pain Points:**
    *   This section displays a summarized, categorized list of the problems scraped from Reddit. It **connects each pain point to a potential AI solution.**
    *   **UI:**
        *   **Pain Point:** "I waste hours writing status reports." -> **Potential AI Feature:** "Automated Weekly Digest Generator"
        *   **Pain Point:** "My team can't estimate timelines." -> **Potential AI Feature:** "Predictive Deadline Forecaster"

*   **Section 2: The Competitive AI Landscape:**
    *   A clean table showing what Asana, Monday.com, and Trello have already launched.
    *   An LLM-generated analysis points out the "white space": *"None of the major competitors have launched a predictive timeline feature yet. This is a potential market opportunity."*

*   **Section 3: The Interactive Feature Prioritization Matrix:**
    *   This is the "wow" feature. The app creates a **2x2 chart (an "Eisenhower Matrix").**
        *   The Y-axis is **"Customer Value"** (derived from how often the pain point was mentioned on Reddit).
        *   The X-axis is **"Implementation Difficulty"** (an estimate from the LLM based on the complexity of the feature).
    *   Each potential AI feature is plotted on this chart as a clickable dot.
    *   **The Magic:** There is an **interactive slider** at the top labeled **"Strategic Focus."** The options are `[Quick Wins]`, `[Big Bets]`, and `[Fill the Gaps]`.
        *   When the user clicks `[Quick Wins]`, the chart highlights the features in the "High Value, Low Difficulty" quadrant.
        *   When they click `[Big Bets]`, it highlights the "High Value, High Difficulty" quadrant.

*   **Section 4: The Recommended Roadmap:**
    *   Based on the matrix, Minato generates a final, opinionated recommendation.
    *   **Text:** *"Based on this analysis, we recommend a two-phased approach.
        > **Phase 1 (Quick Win):** Launch the 'Automated Weekly Digest Generator'. It solves the most common customer pain point and directly competes with Asana's core AI feature.
        > **Phase 2 (Big Bet):** Begin R&D on the 'Predictive Deadline Forecaster'. This is a high-difficulty feature, but it addresses a major customer need and represents a true competitive differentiator."*

### **The Result**

The Product Marketing Director receives a single "Magic Link." In one hour, she has gone from a state of complete uncertainty to having:
1.  A clear, quantified understanding of what her customers are actually struggling with.
2.  A complete landscape analysis of her competitors' real AI features.
3.  An interactive tool to prioritize potential features based on value and effort.
4.  A data-driven, defensible strategic roadmap to present to her CEO.

Minato didn't just give her an answer. It gave her **clarity, evidence, and a plan.** This is the kind of problem-solving that professionals desperately need and will pay a premium for.
