That is a brilliant and essential question. It forces us to prove Minato's value beyond the corporate, white-collar world. If Minato is truly a "Strategic Partner," it must be able to provide real, tangible value to someone working a tough, operational job like at a 7-Eleven.

The answer is yes, but the *type* of analysis is completely different. For a 7-Eleven employee, the "assets" are not stocks or marketing campaigns; they are **time, inventory, and career progression.** Minato's "360째 Evaluation" must adapt to this reality.

Let's explore two powerful, real-world pain points for two different 7-Eleven employees.

---

### **Example 1: The Ambitious Shift Worker**

*   **The Professional:** A dedicated employee who has been working at a busy 7-Eleven for a year. They are reliable, but they feel stuck.
*   **Her Pain Point & High-Stakes Question:** "I want to get promoted to Assistant Manager. My boss is always too busy to mentor me. I don't know what skills I'm supposed to learn or how to prove I'm ready for more responsibility. **Give me a concrete action plan to get promoted.**"

**Minato's "360째 Career Progression Dossier":**

This is not a financial analysis; it's a personalized professional development and strategy plan.

1.  **Phase 1: "Live Web" Research (No User Data Needed):**
    *   **Task 1 (`scrape_job_descriptions`):** Minato uses **Browser Use** to scrape the official job descriptions for "7-Eleven Crew Member" and "7-Eleven Assistant Manager" from 7-Eleven's career site and Indeed.
    *   **Task 2 (`find_real_world_challenges`):** It scrapes the `r/7Eleven` and `r/retail` subreddits for the most common complaints and problems that employees face daily (e.g., "inventory counts are always wrong," "dealing with difficult customers," "food waste from the hot dogs").
    *   **Task 3 (`find_training_resources`):** It uses the **YouTube API** to find the best, free tutorials on "retail inventory management," "customer de-escalation techniques," and "food safety standards."

2.  **Phase 2: The "Living Dossier" - An Interactive Promotion Plan (Streamlit App):**
    *   Minato generates and deploys an interactive application to CodeSandbox that becomes the employee's personal career coach.
    *   **Section 1: The "Skills Gap" Analysis.**
        *   A clear, side-by-side table comparing the scraped responsibilities of a Crew Member vs. an Assistant Manager. This visually shows the user exactly what new skills they need to acquire (e.g., "Cash Handling" vs. "Daily Cash Reconciliation," "Stocking Shelves" vs. "Inventory Ordering").
    *   **Section 2: Your Personalized "Upskill" Module.**
        *   An interactive checklist of the skills identified above.
        *   Each checklist item (e.g., `[ ] Master Inventory Management`) is a dropdown. When clicked, it reveals the curated YouTube tutorial videos for that specific skill.
    *   **Section 3: The "Solve a Store Problem" Initiative (The "Wow" Feature).**
        *   This is Minato's key strategic insight. It says: "The fastest way to get promoted is to solve a problem your manager has."
        *   It presents the data from the Reddit scrape: *"Analysis of employee discussions shows that the #1 operational headache is inaccurate inventory counts for high-turnover items."*
        *   It then generates a mini-playbook:
            > **Your Promotion Project:** "For the next two weeks, manually track the inventory of the top 5 drink products. At the end of the two weeks, present a simple, one-page report to your manager showing the discrepancy. Here is a template for that report and a script for how to propose it to your boss."

3.  **The Result:** The employee receives a "Magic Link." They now have a clear, actionable plan. They know exactly what to learn, have the resources to learn it, and have a concrete project that will make them look like a proactive superstar to their manager. Minato has provided a level of personalized career coaching they could never get otherwise.

### **Example 2: The Franchise Owner**

*   **The Professional:** The owner of a single 7-Eleven franchise in a busy urban area.
*   **His Pain Point & High-Stakes Question:** "My profits are getting squeezed. I think my biggest problem is **inventory waste**, especially the hot food and fresh coffee that I have to throw out every day. How do I order more effectively to reduce waste without running out during a rush?"

**Minato's "360째 Dynamic Inventory & Waste Reduction Dashboard":**

1.  **Phase 1: Hyperlocal "Live Web" Research:**
    *   **Task 1 (`get_local_event_schedule`):** Minato uses **Browser Use** to scrape the local city's event calendar and nearby community centers for events that could drive unusual foot traffic (e.g., a street fair, a concert, a sports game).
    *   **Task 2 (`get_hyperlocal_weather_forecast`):** It uses a weather API (**OpenWeatherMap**) to get the 7-day forecast for that specific zip code.
    *   **Task 3 (`find_industry_best_practices`):** It scrapes articles from "Convenience Store News" for best practices on "fresh food inventory management."

2.  **Phase 2: The Interactive "Day-Ahead" Simulator (Streamlit App):**
    *   Minato generates and deploys an interactive dashboard for the owner to use *every morning*.
    *   **Section 1: Today's "Context Briefing".**
        *   The app displays in plain English: `"Today is Tuesday. Weather: 85째F and Sunny. Local Events: There is a convention at the nearby hotel, expect higher than usual morning traffic."`
    *   **Section 2: The Interactive Ordering Model.**
        *   This is the core tool. It has sliders and inputs for key items.
        *   `Input: How many croissants did you throw away yesterday?`
        *   `Input: How many hot dogs?`
        *   `Slider: How many coffee pots to brew for the morning rush?`
        *   `Slider: How many taquitos to order for the lunch rush?`
    *   **Section 3: The AI-Powered Recommendation (The "Wow" Feature).**
        *   Based on all the live data, the model provides a clear, actionable recommendation.
        *   **The Output:**
            > **"MINATO'S RECOMMENDATION FOR TODAY:**
            > *   **Coffee:** **Increase** morning brew by 15% to capture traffic from the hotel convention.
            > *   **Hot Dogs:** **Decrease** your lunch order by 20%. The hot weather forecast strongly correlates with lower hot food sales.
            > *   **Slurpees:** **Increase** your syrup order by 25%. High temperatures will drive significant demand.
            > **Projected Impact:** Estimated reduction in food waste costs by $50-$75 today."

3.  **The Result:** The franchise owner now has a dynamic, intelligent assistant. Every day, they can consult their personalized Minato dashboard to make data-driven ordering decisions that directly impact their bottom line. Minato has taken external, unstructured data (weather, local events) and turned it into a concrete, profit-driving operational tool.
