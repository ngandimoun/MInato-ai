diffference between minato and others 


Yes. You have perfectly grasped the final, crucial distinction.

Minato provides something far beyond a "report" and vastly more strategic than a "deep research" task log.

### How to Call the Feature

The most accurate and powerful name for this feature is the **"Living Dossier"** or the **"Interactive Strategy Engine."**

### **The Definitive Comparison: Why Minato is in a Different League**

Let's put all three on a spectrum of value to make the difference crystal clear.

**The User's Question:** "Should I open a cafe in Sheffield?"

#### **Level 1: The AI Chatbot (e.g., ChatGPT Pro)**

*   **What it does:** Uses its internal knowledge and maybe a single web search to provide a well-written, text-based answer.
*   **The Output:** A **"Memo."**
    > *"Opening a cafe in Sheffield could be a good idea. The market is competitive. You should consider factors like location, your unique selling proposition, and local demographics. Here are some general steps to follow..."*
*   **The User's Feeling:** "Okay, that's some helpful generic advice. Now I have to go do all the real research myself."

#### **Level 2: The Deep Research Agent (e.g., Manus.im)**

*   **What it does:** Executes a series of pre-defined or user-defined tasks to gather data from the web.
*   **The Output:** A **"Research Binder"** or a **"Task Log."**
    > *"Task 1 Complete: Scraped Google Maps. Result: [List of 25 cafes in Sheffield].
    > Task 2 Complete: Scraped demographic data. Result: {Population: 556k, Avg Income: Â£31k}.
    > Task 3 Complete: Scraped news articles. Result: [List of 5 articles about Sheffield's food scene]."*
*   **The User's Feeling:** "Great, now I have a mountain of raw data. I am overwhelmed and still have to spend the next two days analyzing this myself to find an actual insight."

#### **Level 3: The Interactive Strategy Engine (Minato)**

*   **What it does:** It performs the deep research, but then takes the two most critical, transformative steps: **Synthesis and Interactive Modeling.**
*   **The Output:** The **"Living Dossier."** A single "Magic Link" to a live, custom-built application.
    > The app contains:
    > *   **The Synthesis:** An executive summary that says, "Analysis shows Sheffield's city centre is saturated with cafes, but the student-heavy S10 postcode has high demand and only two major competitors. This represents a potential market gap."
    > *   **The Interactive Model:** A financial simulator pre-loaded with the scraped data for rent and costs in the S10 area. The user can slide their expected price per coffee and see their projected profitability in that specific neighborhood.
    > *   **The Proof:** A map showing all the competitors, with the S10 postcode visually highlighted.
*   **The User's Feeling:** **"Wow. I not only have the answer, but I understand *why* it's the answer, and I can test the assumptions myself. I have a clear, data-driven path forward."**

**Conclusion:**

*   ChatGPT gives you **advice**.
*   Manus gives you **data**.
*   Minato gives you **clarity and confidence.**

That is the difference. Minato is not just providing a better report. It is providing a fundamentally new way to understand and interact with complex problems.
