### üöÄ Deployment Steps

#### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Ensure all environment variables are set
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=your_convex_deployment
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=your_convex_url
```

#### 2. Database Migration
```sql
-- Run any pending Supabase migrations
-- Tournament tables should already exist from previous phases
-- AI Coach insights table should be available
```

#### 3. Convex Deployment
```bash
# Deploy Convex functions
npx convex deploy

# Verify tournament functions are available
npx convex dev --once
```

#### 4. Next.js Deployment
```bash
# Build and deploy the application
npm run build
npm run start

# Or deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

### üìä Monitoring & Health Checks

#### 1. API Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor `/api/ai-coach/analyze` response times
- [ ] Monitor `/api/tournaments/persist` success rates
- [ ] Monitor `/api/tournaments/distribute-prizes` execution
- [ ] Track OpenAI API usage and costs

#### 2. Convex Function Monitoring
- [ ] Tournament state machine execution
- [ ] Real-time query performance
- [ ] Tournament bracket generation
- [ ] Prize distribution accuracy

#### 3. User Experience Monitoring
- [ ] Tournament registration flow
- [ ] AI Coach insights generation
- [ ] Real-time tournament updates
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness

#### 4. Performance Metrics
- [ ] Page load times for games page
- [ ] Tournament component rendering speed
- [ ] AI Coach analysis response time
- [ ] Convex query latency

### üîß Troubleshooting Guide

#### Common Issues & Solutions

**1. Tournament Functions Not Available**
```bash
# Check Convex deployment status
npx convex dev --once

# Verify functions are exported
cat convex/_generated/api.d.ts | grep tournaments
```

**2. AI Coach API Errors**
```bash
# Check OpenAI API key
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY

# Test API endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ai-coach/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id": "test"}'
```

**3. Tournament UI Not Loading**
```bash
# Check component imports
npm run build

# Verify navigation integration
grep -r "tournaments" app/games/page.tsx
```

**4. Real-time Updates Not Working**
```bash
# Verify Convex connection
npx convex dashboard

# Check useQuery hooks in components
grep -r "useQuery.*tournaments" components/
```

### üìà Success Metrics

#### Phase 4 KPIs
- **Tournament Engagement**: Number of tournament registrations per day
- **AI Coach Usage**: Percentage of players using AI Coach features
- **Tournament Completion Rate**: Percentage of started tournaments that complete
- **User Retention**: Players returning to use tournament features
- **Performance**: Average response time for AI Coach analysis
- **Reliability**: Tournament state machine error rate

#### Monitoring Dashboard
```javascript
// Key metrics to track
const phase4Metrics = {
  tournaments: {
    created: 0,
    completed: 0,
    participants: 0,
    averageDuration: 0
  },
  aiCoach: {
    analysisRequests: 0,
    successRate: 0,
    averageResponseTime: 0,
    insightsGenerated: 0
  },
  performance: {
    pageLoadTime: 0,
    apiResponseTime: 0,
    convexQueryTime: 0,
    errorRate: 0
  }
};
```

### üéØ Post-Deployment Tasks

#### 1. User Testing
- [ ] Invite beta users to test tournament features
- [ ] Gather feedback on AI Coach insights quality
- [ ] Test mobile experience thoroughly
- [ ] Verify accessibility compliance

#### 2. Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update user guides with new features
- [ ] Document API endpoints for future reference
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guides for support team
- [ ] Update development setup instructions

#### 3. Feature Rollout
- [ ] Gradual rollout to user segments
- [ ] Monitor error rates during rollout
- [ ] Collect user feedback and iterate
- [ ] Plan next phase enhancements

### üö® Rollback Plan

If critical issues are discovered:

1. **Immediate Actions**
   ```bash
   # Disable tournament features in navigation
   # Revert to previous Convex deployment
   # Disable AI Coach API endpoints
   ```

2. **Database Rollback**
   ```sql
   -- No data loss risk as Phase 4 only adds features
   -- Existing game data remains intact
   ```

3. **Communication Plan**
   - Notify users of temporary feature unavailability
   - Provide timeline for resolution
   - Document lessons learned
