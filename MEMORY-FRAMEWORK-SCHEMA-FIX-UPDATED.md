# Memory Framework Schema Fix - Update

## Issue Fixed

Fixed a follow-up OpenAI API schema validation error:
```
[MINATO-ERROR] [LLM Clients JSON] Exception: OpenAI API Error for JSON Gen (400 invalid_json_schema): 400 Invalid schema for response_format 'entity_relationship_extraction_v3_strict_metadata': In context=('properties', 'relationships', 'items'), 'required' is required to be supplied and to be an array including every key in properties. Missing 'qualifiers'.
```

## Root Cause

After the previous fix that added `additionalProperties: false` and an empty `properties` object to the `qualifiers` field, we encountered a new validation error.

The OpenAI API requires that when a property is defined in a schema with `additionalProperties: false`, all properties must be listed in the `required` array. The `qualifiers` property was missing from the `required` array in the relationship schema items.

## Solution

Updated `lib/prompts.ts` to include 'qualifiers' in the `required` array:

```typescript
// Changed from:
required: ["subj", "pred", "obj", "language"],

// To:
required: ["subj", "pred", "obj", "language", "qualifiers"],
```

## Impact

This fix completes the schema validation for the memory extraction process. The OpenAI API now accepts the schema and can properly extract memory information from conversations.

## Technical Details

When working with OpenAI's strict JSON schema validation:
1. If you set `additionalProperties: false` in a schema object
2. All properties defined must be included in the `required` array, even if they can be null
3. Empty objects (like our `properties: {}`) must still follow this rule

This change ensures that our memory extraction system complies with OpenAI's schema validation requirements without changing the actual data structure or functionality.
