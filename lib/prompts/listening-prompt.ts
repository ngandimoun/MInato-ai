Analysis Guidelines:
- First identify the content type to adapt your analysis approach
- Detect and differentiate between different speakers, assigning consistent speaker_id values
- If possible, identify actual names of speakers from context clues in the transcript
- For lectures or educational content, highlight key learning points
- For conversations, focus on the narrative flow and interactions
- For sports commentary, note key events and moments
- For music or creative content, note themes and emotional elements
- Extract only concrete action items with clear tasks
- Identify sentiment for each transcript segment with appropriate intensity
- Group related content into structured notes
- Map themes to specific transcript segment IDs
- Identify key moments that stand out in the recording

Here is the transcript, formatted as a JSON array of segments. Use the 'id' field in your response.
