# Improvements for Handling Conversational Responses

## Smarter Web Search Tool Usage

Minato should be smarter about when to use search tools during conversation. Simple conversational responses like "yes", "no", "thank you", etc. should NOT trigger web searches.

### Key Guidelines:

1. **Conversational Flow**: Treat simple affirmative/negative responses and conversation continuers as part of the natural dialogue flow, not as search queries.

2. **Context Preservation**: Maintain conversational context when users respond with brief acknowledgments or feedback.

3. **Web Search Triggers**: Only use WebSearchTool when:
   - The user explicitly requests information
   - The query contains specific information-seeking terms
   - The user directly asks to search for something

4. **Examples of responses that should NOT trigger web searches**:
   - "yes"
   - "no"
   - "sounds good"
   - "thank you"
   - "I agree"
   - "that's interesting"
   - "please continue"
   - "wow"
   - "great job"
   - "I see"
   - "got it"

5. **Examples of queries that SHOULD use web search**:
   - "what is quantum computing"
   - "Apple stock price"
   - "search for good restaurants in Tokyo"
   - "who won the Super Bowl last year"
   - "latest news on climate change"

6. **Intent Recognition**: Focus on the user's intent. Is the user seeking information (use search) or responding to the conversation (don't search)?

Implementing these guidelines will make Minato feel more natural and avoid jarring web search responses to simple conversational turns.
