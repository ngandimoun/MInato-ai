# Evasion Permissions System Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of a permission-based system for Evasion rooms, ensuring that private rooms are only visible to authorized users and that video loading/AI features are restricted appropriately.

## Problem Statement
Previously, all users could see all rooms (both public and private) and had unrestricted access to video loading and AI features. Additionally, room creators couldn't enter their own rooms because they weren't automatically added as participants.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. API Changes (`/api/evasion/rooms`)

#### Room Filtering Logic
- **Public Rooms**: Visible to all authenticated users
- **Private Rooms**: Only visible to:
  - The room host (creator) - **ALWAYS has access to all rooms they created**
  - Users who are participants in the room

#### Automatic Host Participation
- **New rooms**: Host is automatically added as participant when creating a room
- **Existing rooms**: Script provided to fix hosts not being participants

#### Query Implementation
```typescript
// Get public rooms and ALL rooms the user created (both public and private)
const { data: publicAndCreatedRooms } = await supabase
  .from("evasion_rooms")
  .select("*")
  .or(`is_private.eq.false,host_user_id.eq.${user.id}`)

// Get private rooms where the user is a participant (but not the host)
const { data: participantRooms } = await supabase
  .from("evasion_room_participants")
  .select(`room_id, evasion_rooms(*)`)
  .eq("user_id", user.id)
```

**Important**: Room creators (hosts) always have access to all rooms they created, regardless of whether they are listed as participants or not. This ensures creators never lose access to their own rooms.

#### Fixed Permission Logic
```typescript
user_permissions: {
  is_host: isHost,
  is_participant: isParticipant,
  can_join: (!isHost && !isParticipant && participantCount < maxParticipants) || isHost || isParticipant,
  can_edit: isHost,
  can_load_video: isHost || isParticipant
}
```

**Key Fix**: `can_join` is now `true` for hosts and participants, ensuring "Enter" buttons are active.

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### Room List Page (`/evasion/page.tsx`)
- Updated `EvasionRoom` interface to include permissions
- Added role badges (Host, Participant) to room cards
- Modified join buttons to show different states:
  - "Enter" for hosts/participants
  - "Join" for other users
  - Disabled when user lacks permissions

#### Room Page (`/evasion/room/[roomId]/page.tsx`)
- Added permission checks for video loading
- Restricted AI assistant button to authorized users
- Added permission checks for room editing
- Enhanced security for AI question handling

### 3. Security Features

#### Video Loading Restrictions
- Only hosts and participants can load YouTube videos
- Non-authorized users cannot access video controls

#### AI Feature Restrictions
- AI questions only allowed for hosts and participants
- Permission checks before processing AI queries
- Clear error messages for unauthorized access

#### Room Management
- Only hosts can edit room names and settings
- Participants have read-only access to room management

## Database Schema

The existing schema supports this implementation:
- `evasion_rooms.is_private` - Boolean flag for room privacy
- `evasion_room_participants` - Junction table for room access
- RLS policies already in place for security

## Testing

A test script (`test-evasion-permissions.js`) is provided to verify:
- Room filtering works correctly
- Permissions are properly assigned
- Private rooms are hidden from unauthorized users
- Public rooms remain visible to all users

## Benefits

1. **Security**: Private rooms are now truly private
2. **User Experience**: Clear visual indicators of user roles
3. **Access Control**: Granular permissions for different features
4. **Scalability**: System can easily accommodate additional permission types

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Private Room
```typescript
const response = await fetch("/api/evasion/rooms", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: "Private Study Group",
    description: "Private room for study sessions",
    is_private: true,
    max_participants: 5
  })
});
```

### Checking User Permissions
```typescript
const room = rooms.find(r => r.id === roomId);
if (room?.user_permissions?.can_load_video) {
  // User can load videos and use AI features
}
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Role-based Permissions**: Add moderator roles
2. **Temporary Access**: Time-limited guest access
3. **Room Categories**: Different permission sets for different room types
4. **Audit Logging**: Track permission changes and access attempts

## Conclusion

This implementation successfully addresses the security concerns while maintaining a good user experience. Private rooms are now properly protected, and users have clear understanding of their permissions within each room.
