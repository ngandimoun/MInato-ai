# Memory Framework Schema Fix - Metadata Required Fields

## Issue Fixed

Fixed another OpenAI API schema validation error:
```
[MINATO-ERROR] [LLM Clients JSON] Exception: OpenAI API Error for JSON Gen (400 invalid_json_schema): 400 Invalid schema for response_format 'entity_relationship_extraction_v3_strict_metadata': In context=('properties', 'metadata'), 'required' is required to be supplied and to be an array including every key in properties. Missing 'item_names'.
```

## Root Cause

After changing `additionalProperties` to `false` in the metadata object, we encountered another validation error. 

When `additionalProperties` is set to `false`, OpenAI's strict schema validation requires all defined properties to be listed in the `required` array, even if they can be null. The metadata object was missing several properties in its required array.

## Solution

Updated `lib/prompts.ts` to include all defined properties in the metadata object's required array:

```typescript
// Changed from:
required: ["reminder_details", "detected_language"],
additionalProperties: false as const

// To:
required: ["reminder_details", "detected_language", "item_names", "place_names", "date_times"],
additionalProperties: false as const
```

## Impact

This fix completes the strict schema validation requirements for the metadata object in the memory extraction process. The OpenAI API should now accept the schema and properly extract memory information from conversations.

## Technical Note

With OpenAI's strict JSON schema validation:
1. When `additionalProperties: false` is used in an object schema
2. All properties defined in that object must be included in the `required` array
3. This applies even if those properties can be null

These changes ensure that our memory extraction system fully complies with OpenAI's schema validation requirements.
